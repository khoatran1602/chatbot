## Introduction
If you want a chatGPT bot for your own without going through much trouble signing up. You can use this. I build this for you. But borrowing your friend's API key :))).

## Create a .env file with the format:
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=yourAPIkey

## Run
npx vite

That's it, guys. Keep it simple!
